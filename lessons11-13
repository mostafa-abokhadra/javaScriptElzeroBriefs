### variables
use it to store some value that you will be using repeatedly e:g website name
```js
var name = "mostafa", age = 22
```
when you create an html element and give it an id, the id name is gonna be a global variable that you can access in you js file or from any where in the system e:g
```html
<div id="div-id">bokhadra</div>
```
now in your js file
```js
console.log(div-id) //bokhadra
```
you can use the dollar sign in anywhere in your variable
```js
var $dollar$var$ = "$$$"
```
use camel case  to declare the variables 
```js
var userName, myHomeAddress;
```
use "let" and "const" to declare your vars instead of var as it has a lot of problems
```js
let name = "mostafa"
let age = 21
const team = "barcelonaðŸ’™ðŸ’–"
```
