/*  when you create an html element and give it an id,\
    the id name is gonna be a global variable that you can\
    access in you js file or from any where in the system e:g
*/

// you can use the dollar sign in anywhere in your variable
var $dollar$var$ = "$$$"

// use camel case  to declare the variables 
var userName, myHomeAddress;

// use "let" and "const" to declare your vars instead of var as it has a lot of problems
