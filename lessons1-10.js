/*  
    -you can add this line either in the (head tag) of html document or (at the end of the body tag)
    if you put the code in the head tag you will get an error,  that is because the program is executing \
    sequentially line by line, so when you put the script in the head tag it's like you are executing some code \
    in an element that does not exist yet.
    -so the best practice is to put it in the end of the body tag
    -you can still put it in head tag if you want and use (onload event) to wait until the html page is loaded \
     before executing js file.

// this is a comment or

/*
    we put the double or single quotes to print something because if we don't the language compiler \

//DataTypes and Typeof 
typeof "string" or typeof("string") // both syntax is correct
typeof [1, 2, 3] // it's type is object, but it's called array
Number // either int or float or double
null // it's type is object
// string, Object, boolean, undefined, bigint, symbol
